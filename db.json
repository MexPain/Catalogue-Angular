      "overview": "The FormControl instance tracks the value, user interaction, and validation status of the control and keeps the view synced with the model. If used within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child control.\n\nThis directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the ngModel selector to activate it.\n\nIt accepts a domain model as an optional Input. If you have a one-way binding to ngModel with [] syntax, changing the domain model's value in the component class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with [()] syntax (also known as 'banana-in-a-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to the domain model in your class.",
